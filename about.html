      <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        JAC Records was founded in 2017 by Joel Perez, Armond Chatman and Chris
        Coakley. The three met in high school, and became friends bonded by a
        common passion -- music. Unfortunetly, music couldn't save them from
        stirring up mischef, and they were expelled from Schenectady High School
        after a prank on staff memebers went wrong in 2015. For more than two
        years, the three friends continued to hang out and work dead-end jobs,
        but all wanted more out of life. Armond was an aspiring musician with a
        decent local following, but couldn't garner the attention of mid-sized
        or even small record labels. Joel and Chris knew quite a bit about the
        music and entertainment industry, as Joel was the son of singer and
        actress Rosie Perez, and Chris's uncle Tim Coakley was a well-known jazz
        drummer and enthusiast. Wanting to help Armond reach his goals and make
        something of their own lives, Chris and Joel decided they wanted to
        start a record label. However, when they approached Armond with the
        idea, he didn't want their help. He wanted in. So with that, JAC Records
        -- or at least the concept -- was born. Today, JAC Records is one of the
        top small labels in New York State, and continue to help local artists
        reach their full potential.
